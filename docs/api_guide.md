## distinct
*distinct* service takes an intelligence type as parameter, it returns all distinct values that match the type given.
### Example

+ all distinct ip known by *Hippocampe*: 
**Query** :
```
curl -i -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST -d '
{
        "field" : ["ip"]
}' http://localhost:5000/hippocampe/api/v1.0/distinct
```
**Response**:
```
{
  "ip": [
    "8.8.8.8",
    "0.0.0.0"
	]
}
```

+ all distinct ip and url known by *Hippocampe*:
**Query**:
```
curl -i -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST -d '
{
        "field" : ["ip", "url"]
}' http://localhost:5000/hippocampe/api/v1.0/distinct
```
**Response**:
```
{
  "ip": [
    "8.8.8.8",
    "0.0.0.0"
	],
   "url": [
	"http://www.evil.com/malicious.exe",
	"http://www.evil.com/veryMalicious.exe"
	]
}

```

***

## freshness
*freshness* service checks if your feeds are "up to date".
In ```Hippocampe/core/conf/hippo/hippo.conf``` a threshold can be defined, by default it is setted to 1 day:
```
[freshness]
#in days
threshold : 1
```
If the feed has not been querried within the last day, the service returns "NOK", otherwise it returns "OK".
### Example
**Query**:
```
curl -GET http://localhost:5000/hippocampe/api/v1.0/freshness
```

**Response**:
```
{
  "http://autoshun.org/files/shunlist.csv": {
    "freshness": "OK"
  },
  "http://data.phishtank.com/data/online-valid.csv": {
    "freshness": "NOK"
  },
  "http://labs.snort.org/feeds/ip-filter.blf": {
    "freshness": "OK"
  }
```

***

## hipposched
*Hippocampe* retrieves threat intelligence from internet's feed to index it. This is done through [shadowbook](#shadowbook) service.
*hipposched* allows to schedule automaticaly the launch of  [shadowbook](#shadowbook), in other words automatic indexation is possible.
The crontab syntax is used to indicate the job's frequency.
### Example
+ Indexation every 12 hours
**Query**:
```
curl -i -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST -d '
{
        "time" : "* */12 * * *"
}' http://localhost:5000/hippocampe/api/v1.0/hipposched
```
**Response**:
```
{
  "schedule": "* */12 * * *"
}
```

Please be aware that: 

+ the scheduling is stored in *memory*, if the API is stopped and started again, another querry has to be sent to schedule jobs
+ yet, there is no way to get the scheduled frequency from the API
    + looking for the string ```job succesfully schedulled as: * */12 * * *``` in the log can be a workaround
+ if a shadowbook job is already running, as a job A, and another one is about to be launched because of *hipposched*, as a job B
    + job B would be launched after the end of job A


***

## hipposcore
*hipposcore* service takes one or several observables as parameters and returns a score for each. 
The score is ranged between 0 and -100:

+ 0 : observable unknown
+ -100: super evil observable

### Example
**Query**:
```
curl -i -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST -d '
{
        "perugemstones.com" : {"type" : "domain"},
        "198.23.78.98" : {"type" : "ip"},
        "223.184.173.74" : {"type" : "ip"}
}' http://localhost:5000/hippocampe/api/v1.0/hipposcore

```
**Response**:
```
{
  "198.23.78.98": 0,
  "223.184.173.74": {
    "hipposcore": -86.46647167633873
  },
  "perugemstones.com": {
    "hipposcore": -86.46647167633873
  }
}
```
For more details on the *hipposcore* formula, check [this](hipposcore.md).

***

## jobs
*Hippocampe* retrieves threat intelligence from internet's feed to index it. This is done through [shadowbook](#shadowbook) service. 
At the end of the process, a "report" is generated to sum it up. 
*jobs* service allows to return every report generated.

### Example
**Query**:
```
curl -GET http://localhost:5000/hippocampe/api/v1.0/jobs
```

**Response**:
```
{
  "AVSF_66jpkveE_5U5iuW": {
    "duration": "6.52",
    "endTime": "20160506T142317+0200",
    "report": {
      "ET_IP.conf": {
        "activated": true,
        "error": [],
        "link": "http://rules.emergingthreats.net/blockrules/compromised-ips.txt",
        "nbFailed": 0,
        "nbIndex": 1158,
        "nbNew": 1062,
        "nbUpdate": 0
      },
      "snort_IP.conf": {
        "activated": true,
        "error": [],
        "link": "http://labs.snort.org/feeds/ip-filter.blf",
        "nbFailed": 0,
        "nbIndex": 40365,
        "nbNew": 39841,
        "nbUpdate": 0
      }
    },
    "startTime": "20160506T141646+0200",
    "status": "done"
  }
```

The service returns the jobs which *id* is ```AVSF_66jpkveE_5U5iuW```.

+ *duration* is the time spent in minutes for the indexation
+ *endTime* has the format ```"%Y%m%dT%H%M%S%z"```
+ *report* is a JSON document which each key is the source's configuration file
    + *activated* is a boolean.
If the source is activated, it will be querried. If not, it will not.
    + *error* is a list of string.
In case of failure, the exception name will be indicated in the list.
    + *link* is the source's url.
    + *nbFailed* is the number of failure.
A feed is composed by several lines. Sometimes, the process cannot index some lines. *nbFailed* is the exact number.
    + *nbIndex* is the number of element succesfully indexed.
    + *nbNew* is the number of element not known before by *Hippocampe*. These elements are also indexed under the index/type hippocampe/new.
    + *nbUpdate* is the number of element successfully updated.
When an element is already known, its *lastAppearance* date is updated.
+ *startTime* has the format ```"%Y%m%dT%H%M%S%z"```
+ *status* is the job's status.
    + Yet there's only three statuses: ```ongoing```, ```done``` and ```failed```

***

  }
}
```

## laststatus
*lastStatus* service checks if the last indexation went well. It checks the last job report, returns ```OK``` if there's no error and if ```(nbIndexed =! 0 and nbUpdated != 0)```, if not it returns ```NOK```.

When the list is empty, it means that the observable is unknown.

***

## new
*Hippocampe* retrieves threat intelligence from internet's feed to index it.
New intelligences, neve seen before, are also indexed under the index/type hippocampe/new.
*new* service returns all elements under this index/type to search them in your information system.

```

***

## schedreport
With [*hipposched*](#hipposched) service, indexation can be scheduled.
If the indexation is scheduled every 12 hours, *schedReport* checks if an indexation has been launched in the last 12 hours. If so, it returns ```OK```, if not it returns ```NOK``` for every sources.
The threshold is defined in ```Hippocampe/core/conf/hippo/hippo.conf```:
```
[schedReport]

### Example
**Query**:
```
curl -XGET localhost:5000/hippocampe/api/v1.0/shadowbook

```
**Response**:
```
{
