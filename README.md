**Hippocampe** is a threat feed aggregator. It gives your organisation a threat feed 'memory' and lets you query it easily through a REST API or from a Web UI. If you have a [Cortex](https://github.com/CERT-BDF/Cortex) server, there's already an analyzer to query Hippocampe. And if you use [TheHive](https://github.com/CERT-BDF/TheHive) as a security incident response platform, you can customize the JSON output produced by the analyzer to your taste or use the report template that we kindly provide.

Hippocampe aggregates feeds from the Internet in an Elasticsearch cluster. It has a REST API which allows to search into its 'memory'. It is based on a Python script which fetchs URLs corresponding to feeds, parses and indexes them.

# Hipposcore
Hippocampe allows analysts to configure a confidence level for each feed that can be changed over time and when queried, it will provide a score called Hipposcore that will aid the analyst decide whether the analyzed observables are innocuous or rather malicious.

# Roadmap
 * Extracting observable or IOCs from an email or a report 
 * Adding data manually
 * Distinguish fields generate by Hippocampe from those generated by feeds
 * Show related data (eg, when searching for a URL, show the domain as related if hippocampe knows it)
 * Index MISP attributes
